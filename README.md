# tezos-client

This provides a web browser client for [Tezos](https://github.com/tezos/tezos),
written largely in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and compiled to JavaScript.
The client interacts with the JSON RPC interface provided by a tezos-node service.

## Goals

Provide a simple client allowing newcomers to Tezos to explore what the system is about.
This includes browsing the blockchain and exploring the Tezos API.

Build (eventually) a client with wallet functions.

Learn more about Tezos myself in the course of building and extending the client.
